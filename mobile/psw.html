		<h3> 
			Premise:
		</h3>
		Project StreetWars or PSW for short came from a simple idea: using real world maps as a battlefield for an army commanded by the player.  I made this game with four friends when we were all in our early twenties.  The game is built using Java, LibGDX and it can run on Android, iOS using RoboVM (Java -> iOS compiler) and PCs.  We actually got it working with online multiplayer!  The game could theoretically support an unlimited number of players and my friends and I had way too much fun playing together for hours blowing each other up.

    		So probably the coolest part of this was all of the complex servers (hosted on Google web services) which allowed all the multiplayer to happen.  This game also had street-based pathfinding for some of the units, lots of maps services, and AI players to battle against when you couldn't find human friends.  The AI was part of the multiplayer platform so you could play against AI players and friends in the same game.

    		One of the features in this game was the ability for the users to adjust balance in the game by spending in-game currency.
