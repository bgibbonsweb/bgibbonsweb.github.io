		<h3> 
			Premise:
		</h3>
		Duel bots is a two player hot seat arena battle game that I coded using C# and the XNA framework for windows and Xbox when I was 18.  It has a number of different weapons and features a completely destructible stage as well as a level editor.  The more damage a player takes, the farther he is sent flying when hit by a weapon until he is knocked off the stage and the game resets.<br/><br/>

		<h3> 
			Nerd stuff:
		</h3>
		The most interesting technical part of the game was the system that handled the destruction of the stage.  Since any block could be destroyed at any moment, I wanted to find an efficient way of rendering the evolving stage.  All the blocks are stored into a texture that only redraws itself when something is destroyed.  Then I can just draw the entire texture instead of all of the individual blocks instead.

		<h3> 
			The level editor:
		</h3>

		The level editor as part of this game was really cool.  You could move between playing and editing the level seamlessly by just pressing one button.

		Notice how the blocks look different.  They all got blended with another texture layer.
